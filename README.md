## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  I'm Caio Pizzol, a software engineer specializing in scalable systems and API design. My programming journey began 20 years ago, crafting websites with Dreamweaver and Flash. This early start led me through diverse technologies - from Assembly and C for embedded systems to mastering JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and cloud platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Today, my technical foundation spans Python, FastAPI, Node.js, JavaScript, Vue3, and cloud databases like Google Spanner and PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p>
  By day, I lead API development and developer experience initiatives as Head of DX at <a href="https://superdoc.dev" target="_blank">SuperDoc</a>. My focus is on building reliable infrastructures and tools that enhance developer productivity.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also the creator of <a href="https://github.com/usepolvo" target="_blank">Polvo</a>, an open-source solution addressing the complexities of API integration. It standardizes third-party app integrations with built-in support for async operations, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not coding or leading engineering teams, I'm spending time with my kids, Chloe and Martin.
