Hi there 👋

I'm Caio, Head of DX at [SuperDoc](https://superdoc.dev) - designing APIs and building tools developers actually want to use.

I've been writing code for 20 years. Currently obsessed with the integration layer AI agents will need to be useful in the real world.

My GitHub is full of half-finished experiments and a few things that actually work.

**What I'm exploring**

**[cnpj.chat](https://cnpj.chat)** / **[fipe.chat](https://fipe.chat)** - Query Brazilian market data with plain English. No API docs, no auth tokens. Proof of concept for AI agents accessing real-world data without integration nightmares.

**[Polvo](https://github.com/usepolvo)** - Open-source toolkit for API integrations. Handles rate limits, retries, pagination—all the annoying stuff developers deal with.

**[Sniff](https://github.com/caiopizzol/sniff)** - Framework for deploying AI agents that respond to workspace events. YAML config, ships to Linear/GitHub/Slack.

**[DocWorks](https://github.com/caiopizzol/docworks)** - CLI that sends AI agents to test your docs and report what's broken.

If you're building in the AI agent space or thinking about developer tools, reach out.
